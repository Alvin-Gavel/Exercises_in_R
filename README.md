This repository contains code I have written as an exercise in learning to program in R, and which happens to give output that's neat to look at. So far, the contents are:

`README.md`: This text

`binomial_experiment.r`: Plots the results of fitting a binomial function to observed data. The idea is that you should be able to see how the probability _p(P|n,k)_ converges towards the true _P_ as _n_ increases.

`BE_test_script.r`: A very short script that tests `binomial_experiment`
